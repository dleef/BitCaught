To run BitCaught: first, ensure that you have Tensorflow, pandas, and scikit-learn installed on your device (all pip installable). Then, type "python3 MaliciousModel.py" to begin the ten-fold cross validation process on the simple neural network with 19-dimensional BitcoinHeist data. To execute the deep neural network, type "python3 MaliciousModelDeep.py" and it will begin executing on the same data.

Note: Do not run any of the other python files in the parent directory as they are for data collection and thus can alter the correctly formatted, preexisting data. Also, the API keys have been removed from those files so they will exit upon execution.
